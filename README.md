<p>This is a terminal made in HTML/CSS/Javascript/jQuery</p>

<p>This application makes use of the HTML5 file system.</p>

<p>I took some help with the basics from <ahref="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/filesystem/">here</a>.</p>

<p>PS- I tried most of this on my own and was a long way through with implementing the terminal only to find a demo by Eric Bidelman himself at the end of his tutorial. This isn't a bit by bit ripoff of his version. I've even implemented a few extra commands. Enjoy</p>
